In this repository, I created a visualization dashboard website using plots based on a dataset that contains information about belly button flora diversity in different individuals. For this, I used Plotly for JavaScript.

**Navigating Through The Repository**

The structure of the repository is simple:

In the main repo page, you can find the HTML files for the main web page.
In data, you can find the json file with the sample data.
In static/js, you can find the JavaScript app.
In screenshots you can find screenshots regarding the web page.

## Dashboard Contents

The dashboard contains:

1. A dropdown menu with all of the sample IDs, for the user to choose from.

2. A section with the sample metadata, displaying each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object on the page.

3. A bar chart to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.

4. A bubble chart that displays each bacteria in the sample.

**Bonus:** 

5. A gauge chart indicating the times per week the individual washes their belly button.

Additionally, the plots are updated any time that a new sample is selected!
